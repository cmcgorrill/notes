# Viticulture and Viniculture

**viticulture** - growing
vitis = grape families
vitis vinefera = best wine grapes in the world

##### Vineyard Issues
Climate
* continental = extreme changes
* mediterranean = unchanging
* maritime = changing, but not extreme

Soils
* slate in germany, steep slopes
* shale in the fingerlakes
* gravel drains well
Nutrients
* vines can grow where other crops can't
* don't need as many nutrients
Grapes
* clones
* trellis
Diseases

Preadators/Pests
* birds
* black bears
* wild turkeys
* kangaroos knock shit over
* 
Weather

Aspect

##### Veraison
* grapes stop growing
* colors change
* berry softens
* tart and high acid that will convert to sugar

*viniculture* - making

##### Viniculture Issues
* Malo---lactic Fermentation
Secondary bacterial fermentation, convert acid to creamier acid
BUTTER
Red wine goes through it
* Lees
dead yeast cells and particles wine can rest on
* Tannin
mouth drying element in grape skin
bitter
* Brix
measurement of sugars in grapes or other foods 
* Wood, oak barrels
..* neutral after about 4 years
..* $500-$700 for american
..* some will put wood chips into the wine instead of putting the wine in barrels
..* "head" is the end of the barrel

**pinot noir** is a thin skinned grape
lower alcohol, higher acid, less tannin

**merlot** is medium. goldilocks of the wine world
medium skin, medium climate, medium body, medium tannin, medium acid

**cabernet sauvignon**
heavy skin, longer time to grow

**pinot noir**
sidewise

## REISLING WEEK
**Aust**ria -> Austere -> Strict
Terrior
more expensive, not a large producer
harsh, steep landscape


Alsace, France 
Borders Germany
Simple label, says reisling
French labels tend to go by reigon, not grape
gentler slopes, dry area, less concerned about mildew so growing season is longer

Mosel, Germany

Finger Lakes, NY
Microclimates all over
Top 3 Producing Reigon in the world for Reisling
Germany, Alsace, Finger Lakes
Dr. Frank, from Ukraine, planted the vines

Washington State
cloudy, rainy, not much sun
Columbia Valley, east of Cascades
diurnal, desert

**Terrior** - environmental impact on the vine

Tannin comes from...
* Skins
* Stems
* Seeds

Madera - cooked wine
Not a table wine, alcohol added, used for cooking

Chaptalization - addition of sugar during fermentation
Suss

Week 4

### California

Napa Valley

"California" grapes could come from anywhere, probably Central Valley


Phylloxera - can't be gotten rid of

Prohibition
Wineries survived with "wine kits"

Gallo - Largest wine producer - big jugs
Owns Dark Horse

Simply Naked = unoaked, unwooded, unaged

Variatelly labeled = labeling the kind of grape on the bottle
in the US 75% or more allows a wine to be varietally labeled
