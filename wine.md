# Viticulture and Viniculture

**viticulture** - growing
vitis = grape families
vitis vinefera = best wine grapes in the world

##### Vineyard Issues
Climate
* continental = extreme changes
* mediterranean = unchanging
* maritime = changing, but not extreme

Soils
* slate in germany, steep slopes
* shale in the fingerlakes
* gravel drains well
Nutrients
* vines can grow where other crops can't
* don't need as many nutrients
Grapes
* clones
* trellis
Diseases

Preadators/Pests
* birds
* black bears
* wild turkeys
* kangaroos knock shit over
* 
Weather

Aspect

##### Veraison
* grapes stop growing
* colors change
* berry softens
* tart and high acid that will convert to sugar

*viniculture* - making

##### Viniculture Issues
* Malo---lactic Fermentation
Secondary bacterial fermentation, convert acid to creamier acid
BUTTER
Red wine goes through it
* Lees
dead yeast cells and particles wine can rest on
* Tannin
mouth drying element in grape skin
bitter
* Brix
measurement of sugars in grapes or other foods 
* Wood, oak barrels
..* neutral after about 4 years
..* $500-$700 for american
..* some will put wood chips into the wine instead of putting the wine in barrels
..* "head" is the end of the barrel

*pinot noir* is a thin skinned grape
lower alcohol, higher acid, less tannin

*merlot* is medium. goldilocks of the wine world
medium skin, medium climate, medium body, medium tannin, medium acid

*cabernet sauvignon*
heavy skin, longer time to grow

*pinot noir*
