# Week 3
### The Rest of the World

Shandies could have started in a couple places
* Tropics
* Germany
* Other climates

Milk Stout
* Popular in Japan, major growth there

**Rice is adjunt ingredient**

##### Shandy
50% beer, 50% soda is traditional
**Raddler**=50% beer, 50% lemonage
_hazy_ lends itself to ale, like wheat ales


Dark beers don't need as many ingredients, due more intense flavor to start in the ingredients

Sugar in milk stout combats burnt stout flavors

# Week 4
### Eastern Europe

Malt liquor = Lager

# Week 7

Rings in the head indicate alcohol++ or wheat

Two types of trippel
* "true" three grain beer = oats, barley, wheat
* others may use rye

# Final Exam Prep

Ale or Lager?

What is the style of this beer?

Does this fall in accordance with the Reinheitsgebot (barley, wheat, water, hops, yeast)?

Bonus: What's the name of the beer?

1. England
2. Ireland/Scotland
3. Best of the Rest (of the World)
4. Eastern Europe
5. American
6. German
7. Belgium
8. Local

Watch the pour, describe what happens

Look
* Groupings in the Head = is it high alcohol? Wheat? 
* Sediment = Ale
* Crystal Clear = possibly Ale, but usually Lager

Smell
* Spices/Fruits = Probably not Reinheitsgebot kosher

Taste
* Very Hoppy = probably Ale, we haven't had a very hoppy lager in the class
